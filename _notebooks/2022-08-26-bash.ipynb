    "1. **If statements:** These were necessary to simply check if things were installed\n",
    "2. **Checking for files and directories:** I used this in conjunction with if statements to determine if both repositories & programs were installed\n",
    "3. **Git Command Line Interface:** In order to use git in my script, I had to use the Git Command Line Interface to update and clone the repository\n",
    "4. **Putting command output to files:** Primarily I did not want to clog the output so I put the output from commands I was running into /dev/null\n",
    "5. **Piping from one command to another:** A lot of times I had to parse/check the output from a specific command so I had to pipe it to the ``grep`` or ``awk`` commands\n",
    "6. **Variables:** Storing data such as version numbers were useful to keep in variables\n",
    "7. **Running commands in Bash Scripts:** In order to conduct installs in the case that packages weren't installed, I had to run commands inside my bash script, and I also sometimes had to put results from commands into variables"
