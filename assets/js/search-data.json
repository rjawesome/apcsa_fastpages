            "content": "Notes/Homework Unit 1-6 . Unit 1: Primitives (our lesson) . Two main types of data in java: primitives (int, boolean, char, double) and objects (Strings, other classes) | Primitives can be compared with == while for classes it is necessary to use the .equals() method | Primitives do not have methods and properties while these are present in classes (ie. String length() method) | Homework N/A (since we were assigned to present this) Unit 2: Using Objects . | Objects are just an instance created out of a class created w/ a constructor (which takes in parameters describing the object | Methods in objects can be void (returns nothing) or have a return type specified | Static methods and properties are tied to class rather than object (ie. same value for all objects) | Methods can be overloaded (have different sets of parameters) as long as order of types differs between method definitions even with same name | Homework Unit 3: Booleans/If statement . | Booleans store a true/false value (can only be one of these) | Booleans can be generated using comparison expressions (equal/==, greater than/&gt;, less than/&lt;, etc.) | If statements take in a boolean or boolean expression and run if the expression evaluates to “true” | Else &amp; Else if statements can be used in conjunction with if statements to run code if the if statement evaluates to false | De Morgan’s Law: !(a &amp;&amp; b) = !a |   | !b AND !(a |   | b) = !a &amp;&amp; !b (ie. distribute and switch the middle sign) | . | Homework | . MC Score . My final score was 37/40, and I was pretty happy with this score as it would translate to a 5 on the AP Exam if I did decent on the FRQs and meant I got over a 90% on this. | . MC Mistakes &amp; Reflections . Question 15 . . I thought that I and II were correct code that achieved the objective as they both had a for loop and compared adjacent elements to see if they were sorted | I did not notice that for II, when k is data.length-1, the if statement will check data[data.length] and data[data.length-1] Since the indexes of the array range from 1..data.length-1, checking data[data.length] will throw an out of bounds exception | . | This means only I was correct and therefore answer choice A was correct | . Question 26 . . I thought that C was correct because it correctly used an enhanced for loop to traverse the array and checked if the element was odd correctly | The mistake with this answer choice was that it printed arr[x] utilizing x as an index This is incorrect since in an enhanced for loop, x actually represents the value in the array rather than an index | . | This means the correct answer choice was A which was identical to C but replaced arr[x] with x | . Question 30 . . I thought that B was the correct answer as I reasoned that it would first take the characters from index 3 to the end (“plier”), and then add the rest of the word (“com”) | I neglected to see that in the question the first substring was using howFar + 1 instead of howFar as the starting index This means the first string would be “lier” instead of “plier” making the answer “liercom” | . | This leads to the correct answer being C | . Overall Reflections . I felt pretty good about all the concepts covered as most of my mistakes were silly mistakes | In order to improve my score further I could focus on reading the question and answer choices more closely because that is where most of my mistakes came from | .",

            "content": "Qualcomm Speaker Series - WeSTEM to connect students with STEM professionals (Introduction of Engineering) . Summary: . Qualcomm is a great company working on many things such as wireless technology, mobile, 5G, etc. The two speakers, Suma and Nisha, were both engineers from Qualcomm who were able to join engineering through their interest and working hard to get through the ranks. Important skills they used were working with others and being able to solve problems. Especially emphasized by Suma, it is also important to work for your community and help them learn about STEM. Qualcomm is looking for software and hardware engineers so definitely look there in the future. . Speaker #1: Suma (Staff Engineer at Qualcomm, Wireless Technologies/Mobile Modems) . How she got interested in engineering: her mother taught her math and science really early before going to school &amp; school gave an “easy” education, math and science led to engineering | Views on Engineering (from students): application of math, science to be useful to society and make into a big topic | Views of Engineering: main motivation for her mother was the starting salary was high &amp; engineering solves the interesting &amp; challenging problems that the world faces | Choosing a Major: wondering which part of engineering should she choose and asked other parents &amp; friends about various fields in engineering (such as biomedical, software, hardware, industrial, civil, chemical, electrical, robotics, aeronautics, etc.), listed down all options to make a decision and understood what each field and reached decision of electronic/communication engineering (design/develop devices in communications devices) | College Experience: wanted to use software to solve electronics problems, placed into a company after college and did many different diverse positions | Workplace: shared experiences and learned together with other new college students in companies, the company really helped to give a mentor and guide her through the initial days in the company, at the time worked in latest 3G technology which was really cool (mostly in the network side at this time =&gt; for tmobile, verizon, etc.), heard about Qualcomm during a training session | (Qualcomm) Workplace: Qualcomm is working on mobile technologies such as snapdragon and also modems/5g/wireless technology, invented the CDMA technology which is important for wireless connection Quality Communications, Worked on many different projects (mainly NAS protocol stack with registration/deregistration of devices) in many domains such as automotives/mobile/smart meter/etc, 10% thinklab/volunteering activities in qualcomm, TEAM effort to complete all the projects across MANY departments | Breaks: plays tennis, does volunteering, and other activities with office and not always in front of the laptop | . Speaker #2: Nisha Sethia (Director of Engineering at Qualcomm, San Diego) . Apart from job: wife &amp; mother which keeps her busy | Kid: fascinated by how the engineerings &amp; her father’s engineering employees were able to solve interesting and important problems, her dad could help fix broken machines even though he didn’t have much training so this was really interesting, secretly went to father’s machines and try to experiment with that - only girl to enter that area | High School: had many options for classes in high school but also saw it was cool that being a doctor because it was saving lives but was also interested in engineering so in high school she chose both subjects and learned both (but by the end not really interested in medicine &amp; was not good at memorization) | College: going tinto college there was not much information and there was different majors but she chose Computer Engineering because she was interested in math and computers in high school (back then you had to wait 1 week to get 1 hour computer), important to ASK QUESTIONS in order to figure out the end objective, had to take Electrical Engineering because of class space btu she knew she could build on coding skills from this later | First Job: had to choose from many different options and in 2004 at this time cell phone industry still very small, wanted to get into wireless because she was really fascinated by that and joined a startup working on 2G startup (Systems Tests Engineering), verified the product was working per the design | Other jobs: took up the challenge throughout her career in software to continue working up the ladder and took many leadership roles such as getting software designs based on the requirements, moved from mobile to base station side in order to learn the end to end model of the cell phone | Qualcomm: she was excited to move to US and qualcomm because they were one of the trailblazers in the cell phone communications industry and joined for a 4G project in the company and now she is working on the 5G technology, has to lead a team of 50 people in her new project | . Question and Answer: . How do you know what side of engineering to pursue? | Nisha: it evolves over time and keep the growth mindset and think about what you are really interested in but try to narrow it down over time, try out different fields and also combine with your interests | Suma: you can google for what each of the types of engineerings do, where hardware engineerings design and develop the electronics and the software engineers write the software and code for the electronics | What universities specialize in software engineering? In those universities, what are the majors that would help me learn the necessary skills and concepts to get a software developer job in tech app companies (Google, Amazon, Apple, Qualcomm)? What should I do in high school to increase my chances to get admitted into them? | Sherley: Pretty much most colleges have some software engineering so you could really go into such as in here there is UC San Diego, any tech companies want software developers, software and hardware have to work together for a final product, all of these companies have the hardware engineers also, CHALLENGE yourself in high school by taking honors classes or other engineering classes and concurrent enrollment and outside clubs such as robotics | What is one thing you wish you had done earlier that would have helped you with engineering? | Suma: I used to participate in many tests for math and science and preparing for math and science exams really helped her get into the academies for engineering | Nisha: I wish I could have got more exposure to programming and some basic concepts and hardware/software designs and what they mean and she didn’t have the information to learn concepts early on which we should take advantage with | What are some of your biggest challenges and how did you handle them? | Suma: my biggest challenge is actually being mother and going on leave and coming back to work after it was taking a whole break and balancing with the work and life/being mother, helped by her manager and team member and eventually she was able to manage both the work and life | Nisha: Having priorities in work and life is the most important thing, there was also lack of representation in education and trying to find a mentor and role model in order to look up to, also hard to network during her time but now she is more fortunate because qualcomm is very diverse | Another question I had is that I am at a point where I am fluent in about 7 programming languages, and have a good understanding of problem solving - understanding the problem and also understanding what concepts are needed to solve them (I think that’s correct). I actually moved to this city just in July, one of the reasons being the opportunities present in engineering. What are some competitions that I can participate in where I can apply what I’ve learned? | Sherley: Look for robotics clubs at your school or just any clubs at your school that are doing coding or robotics, join the FIRST robotics program, check for job postings especially the game companies are trying to get their games tested by teens | .",

For Skill 1.B, in all the examples I filled out different types of statements such as for, while, recusion, and even dynamic programming. . Addressing CollegeBoard Skill 4.C, we know results are the same because the algorithms perform the same oeprations and alwso the output from our print functions in all 3 methods is the same. . For Skill Skill 5.A, I&#39;ve added timers to each method where we can see recursion is the slowest because it has to recalculate a lot of value while the caching used in the for/while loops is faster. We can also see in the dynamic programming example the recursive solution can become much faster. .",

            "content": "This question involves reasoning about one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays of integers. You will write three static methods, all of which are in a single enclosing class, named DiverseArray (not shown). The first method returns the sum of the values of a one-dimensional array; the second method returns an array that represents the sums of the rows of a two-dimensional array; and the third method analyzes row sums. . In part (a), the instructions are to Write a static method arraySum that calculates and returns the sum of the entries in a specified one-dimensional array. . public static int arraySum (int[] arr1) { int sum = 0; for (int i = 0; i&lt;arr1.length; i++) { sum += arr1[i]; } return sum; } . Here we can test the method with the example array which is [1, 3, 2, 7, 3], which should have a sum of 16. . int[] arrayTest = {1, 3, 2, 7, 3}; System.out.println(arraySum(arrayTest)); . 16 . Part (b) asks to Write a static method rowSums that calculates the sums of each of the rows in a given two dimensional array and returns these sums in a one-dimensional array. The method has one parameter, a two dimensional array arr2D of int values. The array is in row-major order: arr2D[r][c] is the entry at row r and column c. The method returns a one-dimensional array with one entry for each row of arr2D such that each entry is the sum of the corresponding row in arr2D. . public static int[] rowSums(int[][] arr2D) { int[] sums = new int[arr2D.length]; //elements initialize to 0 for (int i = 0; i &lt; arr2D.length; i++) { for (int j = 0; j &lt; arr2D[i].length; j++) { sums[i] += arr2D[i][j]; } } return sums; } . Now we can test with the example: 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 10&nbsp;&nbsp;10&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 . The expected output here is {16, 32, 28, 20}. . int[][] arrayTest2D = { {1, 3, 2, 7, 3}, {10, 10, 4, 6, 2}, {5, 3, 5, 9, 6}, {7, 6, 4, 2, 1} }; int[] sums = rowSums(arrayTest2D); for (int i = 0; i&lt;sums.length; i++) { System.out.println(sums[i]); } . 16 32 28 20 . Part (c) asks us to Write a static method isDiverse that determines whether or not a given two-dimensional array is diverse. The method has one parameter: a two-dimensional array arr2D of int values. The method should return true if all the row sums in the given array are unique; otherwise, it should return false . public static boolean isDiverse (int[][] arr2D) { int[] sums = rowSums(arr2D); for (int i = 0; i &lt; sums.length; i++) { for (int j = i + 1; j &lt; sums.length; j++) { if (sums[i] == sums[j]) return false; // returns false if two elements are the same } } //if end is reached all elements have passed uniqueness test return true; } . We can test with the two provided examples which are diverse and not diverse. . This example is diverse: 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 10&nbsp;&nbsp;10&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 . This example is not diverse: 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 12&nbsp;&nbsp;7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9 8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11&nbsp;&nbsp;10&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 . int[][] arrayTestDiverse = { {1, 3, 2, 7, 3}, {10, 10, 4, 6, 2}, {5, 3, 5, 9, 6}, {7, 6, 4, 2, 1} }; int[][] arrayTestNotDiverse = { {1, 1, 5, 3, 4}, {12, 7, 6, 1, 9}, {8, 11, 10, 2, 5}, {3, 2, 3, 0, 6} }; System.out.println(isDiverse(arrayTestDiverse)); System.out.println(isDiverse(arrayTestNotDiverse)); . true false .",

            "title": "If Statements/Boolean Lesson",
            "content": "Boolean expressions . Boolean expressions are something that can be TRUE or FALSE . For example, we can check if two things are equal, greater than eachother or less than eachother. Here I have some examples of how these expresisons could be used in a quiz context. Below I have some equality examples . char correctAnswer = &#39;A&#39;; char user1Answer = &#39;B&#39;; char user2Answer = &#39;A&#39;; //Check if user 1&#39;s answer was equal to the correct answeer System.out.println(&quot;Is user 1 right?&quot;); System.out.println(user1Answer == correctAnswer); //Check if user 2&#39;s answer was equal to the correct answer System.out.println(&quot;Is user 2 right?&quot;); System.out.println(user2Answer == correctAnswer); . Is user 1 right? false Is user 2 right? true . We can also compare some values and see if they are greater or less than. . int user1Score = 100; int user2Score = 50; int targetScore = 75; //Check if user 1 reached target score System.out.println(&quot;Did user 1 reach the target score?&quot;); System.out.println(user1Score &gt;= targetScore); //Check if user 2 reached target score System.out.println(&quot;Did user 2 reach the target score?&quot;); System.out.println(user2Score &gt;= targetScore); . Did user 1 reach the target score? true Did user 2 reach the target false . An IF statement utilizes boolean expressions and DOES SOMETHING if the expression is true. For example we can use this on the previos two examples . char correctAnswer = &#39;A&#39;; char user1Answer = &#39;B&#39;; char user2Answer = &#39;A&#39;; //Check if user 1&#39;s answer was equal to the correct answeer if (user1Answer == correctAnswer) { System.out.println(&quot;User 1 is right&quot;); } //Check if user 2&#39;s answer was equal to the correct answer if (user2Answer == correctAnswer) { System.out.println(&quot;User 2 is right&quot;); } . User 2 is right . int user1Score = 100; int user2Score = 50; int targetScore = 75; //Check if user 1 reached target score if (user1Score &gt;= targetScore) { System.out.println(&quot;User 1 reached the target score&quot;); } //Check if user 2 reached target score if (user2Score &gt;= targetScore) { System.out.println(&quot;User 2 reached the target score&quot;); } . User 1 reached the target score . Now, going further what if we wanted to complete some action if the user DID NOT reach the target score. In this case we can use an ELSE statement. . int user1Score = 100; int user2Score = 50; int targetScore = 75; //Check if user 1 reached target score if (user1Score &gt;= targetScore) { System.out.println(&quot;User 1 reached the target score&quot;); } else { System.out.println(&quot;User 1 failed&quot;); } //Check if user 2 reached target score if (user2Score &gt;= targetScore) { System.out.println(&quot;User 2 reached the target score&quot;); } else { System.out.println(&quot;User 2 failed&quot;); } . User 1 reached the target score User 2 failed . Now, let&#39;s say that we want to give the points to answers, but there are different points for each answer choice. This would cause us to chain if logic, which is where we can use an ELSE IF statement. . char user1AnswerChoice = &#39;C&#39;; char user2AnswerChoice = &#39;A&#39;; char reallyCorrectAnswer = &#39;D&#39;; char correctAnswer = &#39;B&#39;; char partiallyCorrectAnswer = &#39;C&#39;; char reallyWrongAnswer = &#39;A&#39;; int user1Points = 0; int user2Points = 0; // process user 1&#39;s answer if (user1AnswerChoice == reallyCorrectAnswer) { // really correct answer is 30 points user1Points += 30; } else if (user1AnswerChoice == correctAnswer) { // correct answer is 20 points user1Points += 20; } else if (user1AnswerChoice == partiallyCorrectAnswer) { // partially correct answer is 10 points user1Points += 10; } else if (user1AnswerChoice == reallyWrongAnswer) { // a really wrong answer loses 10 points user1Points -= 10; } else { // 1 point for trying and not choosing the really wrong answer user1Points += 1; } //process user 2&#39;s answer if (user2AnswerChoice == reallyCorrectAnswer) { // really correct answer is 30 points user2Points += 30; } else if (user2AnswerChoice == correctAnswer) { // correct answer is 20 points user2Points += 20; } else if (user2AnswerChoice == partiallyCorrectAnswer) { // partially correct answer is 10 points user2Points += 10; } else if (user2AnswerChoice == reallyWrongAnswer) { // a really wrong answer loses 10 points user2Points -= 10; } else { // 1 point for trying and not choosing the really wrong answer user2Points += 1; } System.out.println(&quot;User 1 has &quot; + user1Points + &quot; points.&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;User 2 has &quot; + user2Points + &quot; points.&quot;); . User 1 has 10 points. User 2 has -10 points. . In this example, we see a lot of chaining with the if statements. This could be greatly simplified if we used a switch statement, which allows us to select code based on the value of a variable. See the example below the previous code transformed to switch cases. . Note that as shown below, the switch statement cases cannot have variables in them as they must be constant expressions. . char user1AnswerChoice = &#39;C&#39;; char user2AnswerChoice = &#39;A&#39;; int user1Points = 0; int user2Points = 0; // process user 1&#39;s answer switch (user1AnswerChoice) { case &#39;D&#39;: user1Points += 30; break; case &#39;B&#39;: user1Points += 20; break; case &#39;C&#39;: user1Points += 10; break; case &#39;A&#39;: user1Points -= 10; break; default: user1Points += 1; break; } //process user 2&#39;s answer switch (user2AnswerChoice) { case &#39;D&#39;: user2Points += 30; break; case &#39;B&#39;: user2Points += 20; break; case &#39;C&#39;: user2Points += 10; break; case &#39;A&#39;: user2Points -= 10; break; default: user2Points += 1; break; } System.out.println(&quot;User 1 has &quot; + user1Points + &quot; points.&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;User 2 has &quot; + user2Points + &quot; points.&quot;); . User 1 has 10 points. User 2 has -10 points. . Another thing to understand related to this is how to combine conditionals together using AND (&amp;&amp;) and OR (||). They mean what they say, AND returns true if both conditions is true while OR returns true if both or one of the conditions is true. See some examples below. The NOT (!) operator is also useful to flip a boolean value. . char correctAnswer = &#39;E&#39;; char user1Answer = &#39;D&#39;; char user2Answer = &#39;E&#39;; // Using AND operator if (user1Answer == correctAnswer &amp;&amp; user2Answer == correctAnswer) { System.out.println(&quot;Both users got it right&quot;); } // Using OR operator if (user1Answer == correctAnswer || user2Answer == correctAnswer) { System.out.println(&quot;At least one user got it right&quot;); } // Using AND + NOT operator if (!(user1Answer == correctAnswer &amp;&amp; user2Answer == correctAnswer)) { System.out.println(&quot;Both users DID NOT get it right&quot;); } // Using OR operator if (!(user1Answer == correctAnswer || user2Answer == correctAnswer)) { System.out.println(&quot;NEITHER user1 nor user2 got it right&quot;); } . At least one user got it right Both users DID NOT get it right . The final relevant thing to understand for if statements &amp; boolean expressions is De Morgan&#39;s Law. This is an important property that can allow you to switch your if statements with AND and OR. It states that NOT (A AND B) = (NOT A) OR (NOT B) and NOT (A OR B) = (NOT A) AND (NOT B). To illustrate this, I will simplify the last two if statements from the previous example using De Morgan&#39;s Law. . // Using first de morgan&#39;s law (Note the use of the != operator meaning NOT EQUAL TO) if (user1Answer != correctAnswer || user2Answer != correctAnswer) { System.out.println(&quot;Both users DID NOT get it right&quot;); } // Using second de morgan&#39;s law if (user1Answer != correctAnswer &amp;&amp; user2Answer != correctAnswer) { System.out.println(&quot;NEITHER user1 nor user2 got it right&quot;); } . Both users DID NOT get it right . Now we reach the end of this lesson. Here are some &quot;hacks&quot; I recommend you can do to further learn these concepts: . Create a quiz or other application that heavily utilizes if statements | Code a custom application in the spring app using if statements | Try to create a menu from scratch (without looking at Mr. M&#39;s code) as it is a great place to utilize switch cases | .",

Colin Szeto: Going to UCSD for mechanical engineering | Antohny Vo: Going to UC Irvine for computer science | Andrew: Going to Mira Costa, hoping to transfer to UCSD | Mabel Szeto: Going to UCSD for aerospace, transfering to cognitive science/machine learning | Allison: Going to UCLA for cognitive science w/ computing | Nitya: Going to UCSD for computer science | . Insights . Try to look at many different options when considering your major and do what you are passionate about | Have perserverance to keep trying in the face of errors and seeing other people that may be better than you | PBL &amp; Working together won’t leave you any time soon so make sure to develop those skills, especially in CS, and figure out strategies to work together | CS is really applicable even in other majors such as using MATLAB software, problem-solving skills, and automating tasks | It is really important to create a resume early as a lot of the interns are hired in September | It is good to work on personal projects to help you learn and stand out a lot | Learning fundemental algorithms such as path finding is really key to CS and real world applications | . Notes . How did you choose your major and how did CS classes help? . colin: I can code pretty well and 3D model even better, look outside of your classmates | anthony: started compsci from a very young age and really liked problem solving and leetcode, hooked from the intro to cs class | andrew: intro to cs allowed him to see the complexity and the theory behind the computer really likes the backends and deployment, reflected on what he wanted to do | mabel: kinda didn’t like his class and CS but knew that it was important to learn, haas been interning at northrop grumman, even aerospace and other majors needs programming, helping w/ mission planning for auto robotics | allison: more of an artsy/business person originally but wants to web design stuff in the future focusing on the UX/UI and knowing what the users want, learned the technical background from the CSP class | nitya: always interested in computer science while she was young, AP CSA helped her to apply the skills to solve the real world problems (covid 19 database) | . What is the biggest challenge you reached with CS? . colin: starting is the hardest part and github errors and keeping the motivation is really important, facing a lot of error messages and there is a solution, googling is really key | anthony: my biggest challenge is clashing egos because comp sci majors are not really kind and are just trying to flex to everyone which is frustrated, focus on your own path rather than everyone else | andrew: the theory behind CS is really hard and is about complicated things that you have to think about now which is a huge transition | mabel: it was hard finding the motivation to do CS, there is someone better than you, having a specific project and purpose helps you a lot, the syntax is frustrating originally | allison: starting is the obvious answer but another answer is the temptation to BS assignments and its important to actually try on the assignments properly, don’t cut corners and don’t focus only on the points, try to go above and beyond | nitya: just getting started in a new area in the computer science and you have to lose structure in computer science and everything is interconnected, you don’t need to have a fully fleshed out plan in the class | . Is there any PBL in College comp sci classes? . colin: one hands on project in freshman and one in senior in UCSD which is way less than what you are using in the CSA class so take advantage of that | andrew: there is PBL and tests which are both pretty equal so it is important to know the PBL and also be ready for the exams, especially in the upper division courses there are less exams and more of the PBL | mabel: first few years is a lot general education with a lot of people per class where the teacher can’t help you one-on-one so study groups are really important where you can use the PBL, some project classes and her friend had a “capstone project” class where they had to spend most of her time managing her group bc they were incompetent, this class is MUCH more structured than college where people can freeload off of you, find the style of working with others that is most efficient for you | . Have you applied CS in your major if you aren’t majoring in CS? . colin: there is a lot of menial tasks that can be really useful to be done using CS and that’s why scripts are really useful in other majors, coding is everywhere, MATLAB is really important for the mechanical statements were you use all the programming concepts | andrew: with high level math the CS can be useful especially with python and the math libraries | mabel: MATLAB and other tools like that and CAD softwares are where you can really use the CS in your major, and 3D printing you could code as well, had to do software in her internship, jupyter notebooks are also being used for technical papers to have the graphs | allison: creating a UX and UI you need to know the front end programming which is used in the cog science, stats courses make the computer science really useful to compute statistical values, programming in R is common for stats, MATLAB stuff even used in psycholo9gy where you wouldn’t even think of it | . For existing college students, have you had a job? . colin: put together a resume because that is important to apply for jobs, talk with teachers and go for the above and beyond and stand out with the teachers, show up to office hours and ask a lot of questions, you could be a teacher’s assistant, CSP python and scripting was really useful for the northrop grumman internship | anthony: this is a great coding school and he works at code ninja where he can teach people to code | mabel: one of the robotics lecturers is a lecturer at UCSD and you can see their research labs and clubs in other to get with the professor and ask if they have any space for you | allison: had an internship last year with a church group in order to design their website and do their branding and stuff | nitya: internship for northrop grumman as a highschool intern, exposed | . Did you focus on personal projects . andrew: balance on what you want to do and what you want to in school, have 2 or 3 personal projects | anthony: something for basketball teams | . How does algorithms help with CS? . andrew: path finding algorithms, freedy, sorting, graph, data vis | colin: a lot of simulations and stuff like in order to convert them into CS | mabel: titan AI is a cool club that does a bunch of robotics stuff, machine learning is cool because it stays in STEM major and it isn’t really CS, enjoyed cognitive science type classes, can pick electives that you want, also applies to the robotics team | . Any advice for internships? . anthony: expos let you make a resume, don’t focus too much on the other people’s linkedin | mabel: know when to apply and companies start hiring in september or november (year before), have a resume done by then, also have some linkedin and proof of what you have done, the SCHOOL doesn’t matter that much, clubs and personal projects really differentiate yourselves, smaller companies take high school interns and find things you are interested in, use parents to your advantage | andrew: build a giant network and the referrals can help you a lot | .",

            "title": "How vaccination mandates have fared in the past",
            "content": "In his article “The U.S. Has Had ‘Vaccine Passports’ Before—And They Worked,” Jordan Taylor argues that vaccine passports should be used at the current time to promote the COVID-19 vaccination. More specifically, Taylor argues that this has been done successfully before and now it could help us return to normal life. The main argument used in the article is a historical analysis of the use of “vaccine passports” to combat smallpox by forcing people to get vaccines to enter the country, participate in jobs, or go to social gatherings. Taylor also shows the example of travelers to the US needing to provide vaccination proof in the 20th century, even though requirements in other types of documentation were much less stringent than today. As this program succeeded in near eradication of smallpox by the end of the 20th century, Taylor argues that a similar effect is possible with COVID-19 vaccines. The parallel nature of the situation back then and now is further established as the article highlights the similar concerns from the current time period and from back when smallpox vaccines were used. Such complaints included the fact that the smallpox vaccines were “government tyranny,” an argument much present in modern politics. itself as still an argument today. This also furthers the point as others argue that COVID vaccine mandates are taking pre-existing rights but Taylor shows a precedent of vaccine mandates nullifying this argument. Finally, the article also uses the credibility of doctors from the time who highlighted the importance of the smallpox vaccine to further the argument. Overall, this article presents a compelling argument for the use of vaccine passports in the contemporary time. . I agree with Taylor’s stance as I think vaccine passports would help limit the spread of COVID and in the long term could help to eradicate the disease. His basic argument makes sense as it shows the effectiveness of vaccine passports in the smallpox epidemic and highlights how this is similar to the COVID pandemic. This leads to a simple conclusion that vaccine passports would be helpful in combating COVID. I also want to highlight the pertinence of Taylor’s argument relating to vaccination requirements on entry to the United States, as it relates to issues today such as Novak Djokovic being banned from participating in the US Open for refusal of vaccination. All COVID vaccines used in the United States are at least 90% effective at stopping COVID-19 infection according to clinical trials (Katella). Although current vaccines do have some limitations against newer variants such as omicron, new booster shots are being worked on to target these variants which could be included in vaccine passports. The vaccine mandates have yielded decreased rates of infection and deaths at colleges that required vaccines (Acton et al.). This would show that requiring vaccines to do public activities could also decrease the spread of COVID-19 and decrease both deaths and cases. Overall, current evidence clearly supports Taylor’s claim that vaccine passports should be used and hence I agree with Taylor’s stance. . Works Cited .

            "title": "Why you should use Svelte instead of React?",
            "content": "State management system . Svelte is a Web Framework which provides an easy to use state management system without the drawbacks of a slow virtual DOM (unlike React and Vue). Additionally, it is very similar to normal HTML/CSS/JS, which means it has less of a learning curve. Svelte uses the .svelte file extension for its files, which are really similar to normal HTML files. If you want to export a javascript variable to your HTML, just export it in a script tag. You can then access it in your HTML by enclosing the variable in curly brackets . &lt;script&gt; export let awesome_var = &quot;Svelte is cool!&quot;; &lt;/script&gt; &lt;h1&gt;{ awesome_var }&lt;/h1&gt; . When you change the variable, your HTML will automatically be updated. No need for unnecessary calls such as setState in React . &lt;script&gt; export let awesome_var = &quot;Svelte is cool!&quot;; function editVar () { awesome_var = &quot;Svelte is really cool!&quot; } &lt;/script&gt; &lt;h1&gt;{ awesome_var }&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;button on:click={editVar}&gt;Make Svelte really cool&lt;/button&gt; . When you press the button, the h1 will automatically update with the new text. In addition, you might have noticed that instead of onclick, I used on:click, which is the way Svelte handles events. . . Slots . Another feature that svelte provides is slots, which makes it super easy to use and create custom components. Essentially, I can template my component, and then have the consumer of the component fill in the HTML for some of the parts. For instance, let’s say I’m creating a layout component, which has 3 divs. We can then create slots, which would allow the user of the component to specify what to put in those divs. This is what I would put in CustomComponent.svelte. . &lt;!-- These divs could be styled by the component creator --&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;slot name=&quot;div1&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;slot name=&quot;div2&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;slot name=&quot;div3&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; . Now, in my app component, I can use this CustomComponent I created by importing it. I can then easily specify what to put in the slots. . &lt;script&gt; //import CustomComponent import CustomComponent from &quot;./CustomComponent.svelte&quot; &lt;/script&gt; &lt;CustomComponent&gt; &lt;span slot=&quot;div1&quot;&gt;This is the text I want in div1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span slot=&quot;div2&quot;&gt;This is the text I want in div2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span slot=&quot;div3&quot;&gt;This is the text I want in div3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/CustomComponent&gt; . CSS . Additionally, CSS is exactly the same as you would do with a normal HTML file, you would just add a style tag. For instance, here I make all the spans have a background color of red. . &lt;style&gt; span { background-color: red; } &lt;/style&gt; . One thing to note about styles with svelte is that they are shallow. This means if I had some spans in my CustomComponent, the styles I specify in my App component would not apply to those spans. . Overall, with all these features, it is clear that you should use Svelte as your go-to web framework. .",
