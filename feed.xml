More specifically, Taylor argues that this has been done successfully before and now it could help us return to normal life. The main argument used in the article is a historical analysis of the use of “vaccine passports” to combat smallpox by forcing people to get vaccines to enter the country, participate in jobs, or go to social gatherings. Taylor also shows the example of travelers to the US needing to provide vaccination proof in the 20th century, even though requirements in other types of documentation were much less stringent than today. As this program succeeded in near eradication of smallpox by the end of the 20th century, Taylor argues that a similar effect is possible with COVID-19 vaccines. The parallel nature of the situation back then and now is further established as the article highlights the similar concerns from the current time period and from back when smallpox vaccines were used. Such complaints included the fact that the smallpox vaccines were “government tyranny,” an argument much present in modern politics. itself as still an argument today. This also furthers the point as others argue that COVID vaccine mandates are taking pre-existing rights but Taylor shows a precedent of vaccine mandates nullifying this argument. Finally, the article also uses the credibility of doctors from the time who highlighted the importance of the smallpox vaccine to further the argument. Overall, this article presents a compelling argument for the use of vaccine passports in the contemporary time.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why you should use Svelte instead of React?</title><link href="https://rjawesome.github.io/apcsa_fastpages/web/2022/08/28/comparison-post.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why you should use Svelte instead of React?" /><published>2022-08-28T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-08-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://rjawesome.github.io/apcsa_fastpages/web/2022/08/28/comparison-post</id><author><name></name></author><category term="web" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A description of why Svelte is better than React]]></summary></entry></feed>
