# Overall insights
I learned a lot from this speaker event. One of the key things was that I learned that it is necessary to work in a team and work fast, to reach project deadlines and to quickly adapt to new trends. I also learned that you must be able to learn on the spot as new technologies are always coming out and you need to "learn how to learn." Additional learnings is that you can always pivot your career as for the speakers they may have not started out in CS or their original field but by just contionusly trying to learn they were able to enter a new career path and see new opportunties. The mission statements also made me realize how much of an impact we can have on the world through our work in computer science.
