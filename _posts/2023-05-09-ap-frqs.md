## FRQ 1
- This FRQ has you working the AppointmentBook class, which allows someone to book appointments in 8 periods, each of which has minutes 0-59
- Appointments can only take consecutive minutes and must be contained within the same period
- Helper functions of isMinuteFree (to see whether a mintue is used) and reserveBlock (to actually reserve a time slot)

### FRQ 1a
- You have to write a method ``findFreeBlock`` that takes in a period and length of time, and looks for the first consecutive block of time that is availiable
- Examples given by CollegeBoard

- My solution is below (with comments)
```java
public int findFreeBlock(int period, int duration) {
  // stores the start of the current block we are on
  int curStart = 0;
  // stores the length of the current block we are on
  int curLength = 0;
  
  // loop through all minutes in the period
  for (int i = 0; i<=59; i++) {
    if (isMinuteFree(period, i)) {
      // increase the length of our block
      curLength++;
    }
    else {
      // clear the current block as minutes must be consecutive
      curLength = 0;
      curStart = i+1;
    }
    
    // check if our block has reached the required length
    if (curLength == duration) {
      return curStart;
    }
  }
  
  // no suitable block has been found
  return -1;
}
```

### FRQ 1b
- You now have to write the method ``makeAppointment`` using ``findFreeBlock`` to make an appointment within a period range with a certain duration
- For this, you would use the helper method ``reserveBlock``
- Examples given by CollegeBoard

- My solution is below (with comments)
```java
public boolean makeAppointment(int startPeriod, int endPeriod, int duration) {
  // loop through all the possible periods we could make an appointment in
  for (int period = startPeriod; period <= endPeriod; period++) {
    // look for a free block in this period
    int block = findFreeBlock(period, duration);
    
    // check if there is a block
    if (block != -1) {
      // reserve this block
      reserveAppointment(period, block, duration);
      return true;
    }
  }
  
  // no suitable block found
  return false;
}
```
