## FRQ 1
- This FRQ has you working the AppointmentBook class, which allows someone to book appointments in 8 periods, each of which has minutes 0-59
- Appointments can only take consecutive minutes and must be contained within the same period
- Helper functions of isMinuteFree (to see whether a mintue is used) and reserveBlock (to actually reserve a time slot)

### FRQ 1a
- You have to write a method ``findFreeBlock`` that takes in a period and length of time, and looks for the first consecutive block of time that is availiable
- Examples given by CollegeBoard
- My solution is below (with comments)
```java
public int findFreeBlock(int period, int duration) {
  // stores the start of the current block we are on
  int curStart = 0;
  // stores the length of the current block we are on
  int curLength = 0;
  
  // loop through all minutes in the period
  for (int i = 0; i<=59; i++) {
    if (isMinuteFree(period, i)) {
      // increase the length of our block
      curLength++;
    }
    else {
      // clear the current block as minutes must be consecutive
      curLength = 0;
      curStart = i+1;
    }
    
    // check if our block has reached the required length
    if (curLength == duration) {
      return curStart;
    }
  }
  
  // no suitable block has been found
  return -1;
}
```

### FRQ 1b
- You now have to write the method ``makeAppointment`` using ``findFreeBlock`` to make an appointment within a period range with a certain duration
- For this, you would use the helper method ``reserveBlock``
- Examples given by CollegeBoard
- My solution is below (with comments)
```java
public boolean makeAppointment(int startPeriod, int endPeriod, int duration) {
  // loop through all the possible periods we could make an appointment in
  for (int period = startPeriod; period <= endPeriod; period++) {
    // look for a free block in this period
    int block = findFreeBlock(period, duration);
    
    // check if there is a block
    if (block != -1) {
      // reserve this block
      reserveAppointment(period, block, duration);
      return true;
    }
  }
  
  // no suitable block found
  return false;
}
```

## FRQ 2
- This FRQ is about class definitions, specifically for the `Sign` class
- `Sign` class constructor has 2 params: message and width
- message is split according to the width to display on a sign
- `numberOfLines` method returns int of amount of lines needed to display
- `getLines` returns message split with semicolons

```java
public Sign {
  // initialize private variables
  private int width;
  private String message;

  // constructor
  public Sign(String message, int width) {
    this.message = message;
    this.width = width;
  }

  // returns number of lines needed to display message
  public int numberOfLines() {
    // if message length is divisible by width, return message length / width
    int numLines = message.length() / width;

    // if message length is not divisible by width, add 1 to numLines
    // checks edge case for not divisible
    if (message.length() % width != 0) {
      numLines++;
    }

    return numLines;
  }

  // returns string needed to display message
  public String getLines() {
    // initialize string to return
    String lines = "";

    // loop through message
    for (int i = 0; i < message.length(); i++) {
      // add character to lines
      lines += message.charAt(i);

      // if index is divisible by width, add semicolon
      if (i % width == 0 && i != 0) {
        lines += ";";
      }
    }

    return lines;
  }
}
```
