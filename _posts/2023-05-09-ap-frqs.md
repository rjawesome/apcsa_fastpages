## FRQ 1
- This FRQ has you working the AppointmentBook class, which allows someone to book appointments in 8 periods, each of which has minutes 0-59
- Appointments can only take consecutive minutes and must be contained within the same period
- Helper functions of isMinuteFree (to see whether a mintue is used) and reserveBlock (to actually reserve a time slot)

### FRQ 1a
- You have to write a method ``findFreeBlock`` that takes in a period and length of time, and looks for the first consecutive block of time that is availiable
- Examples given by CollegeBoard
- My solution is below (with comments)
```java
public int findFreeBlock(int period, int duration) {
  // stores the start of the current block we are on
  int curStart = 0;
  // stores the length of the current block we are on
  int curLength = 0;
  
  // loop through all minutes in the period
  for (int i = 0; i<=59; i++) {
    if (isMinuteFree(period, i)) {
      // increase the length of our block
      curLength++;
    }
    else {
      // clear the current block as minutes must be consecutive
      curLength = 0;
      curStart = i+1;
    }
    
    // check if our block has reached the required length
    if (curLength == duration) {
      return curStart;
    }
  }
  
  // no suitable block has been found
  return -1;
}
```

### FRQ 1b
- You now have to write the method ``makeAppointment`` using ``findFreeBlock`` to make an appointment within a period range with a certain duration
- For this, you would use the helper method ``reserveBlock``
- Examples given by CollegeBoard
- My solution is below (with comments)
```java
public boolean makeAppointment(int startPeriod, int endPeriod, int duration) {
  // loop through all the possible periods we could make an appointment in
  for (int period = startPeriod; period <= endPeriod; period++) {
    // look for a free block in this period
    int block = findFreeBlock(period, duration);
    
    // check if there is a block
    if (block != -1) {
      // reserve this block
      reserveAppointment(period, block, duration);
      return true;
    }
  }
  
  // no suitable block found
  return false;
}
```

## FRQ 2
- This FRQ is about class definitions, specifically for the `Sign` class
- `Sign` class constructor has 2 params: message and width
- message is split according to the width to display on a sign
- `numberOfLines` method returns int of amount of lines needed to display
- `getLines` returns message split with semicolons

```java
public Sign {
  // initialize private variables
  private int width;
  private String message;

  // constructor
  public Sign(String message, int width) {
    this.message = message;
    this.width = width;
  }

  // returns number of lines needed to display message
  public int numberOfLines() {
    // if message length is divisible by width, return message length / width
    int numLines = message.length() / width;

    // if message length is not divisible by width, add 1 to numLines
    // checks edge case for not divisible
    if (message.length() % width != 0) {
      numLines++;
    }

    return numLines;
  }

  // returns string needed to display message
  public String getLines() {
    // initialize string to return
    String lines = "";

    // loop through message
    for (int i = 0; i < message.length(); i++) {
      // if index is divisible by width, add semicolon
      if (i % width == 0 && i != 0) {
        lines += ";";
      }
    
      // add character to lines
      lines += message.charAt(i);
    }

    if (lines.length() == 0) {
      lines = null;
    }

    return lines;
  }
}
```

## FRQ 3
- This FRQ requires you to analyze weather data from the WeatherData class
- The ArrayList called temperatures stores the temperatures for the different days and all temperatures are doubles

### FRQ 3a
- You have to write a method ``cleanData`` that modifiers the ``temperatures`` instance variable and removes all temperatures that are less than the lower parameter OR greater than the upper parameter
- Examples given by CollegeBoard
```java
public void cleanData(double lower, double upper) {
    // Iterates through each element in the temperatures
    for (int i = 0; i < temperatures.size(); i++) {
        // Checks if the temperature is outside the boundaries
        if (temperatures.get(i) > upper || temperatures.get(i) < lower) {
            // Remove the element from temperatures
            temperatures.remove(i);
            // Goes back one index to avoid off by one error
            i--;
        }
    }
}
```

### FRQ 3b
- You now have to write the method ``longestHeatWave`` to find the length of the longest heat wave
- A heat wave is a set of consecutive days that have temperatures which exceed the threshold
- Examples given by CollegeBoard
```java
public int longestHeatWave(double threshold) {
    // Creates variables for current heatwave length and maximum heatwave length
    int current = 0;
    int max = 0;
    // Iterates through each element in temperatures
    for (int i = 0; i < temperatures.size(); i++) {
        // If the temperature is greater than the threshold
        if (temperatures.get(i) > threshold) {
            // Add one to the current heatwave length
            current++;
            // If the length of the current heatwave is greater than the maximum heatwave, set the current heatwave to the maximum value
            if (current > max) {
                max = current;
            }
        }
        // If the temperature is less than the threshold, the heatwave has ended so set the current heatwave length to 0 
        else {
            current = 0;
        }
    }
    // Return the length of the longest heatwave
    return max;
}
```

## FRQ 4
- This FRQ gives you a 2D array where each object in the 2D array is of Candy type
- You also have a method ``getFlavor`` which returns the flavor of a candy
- Any element in the 2D array can either have a Candy or be null

### FRQ 4a
- You have to write a method ``moveCandyToFirstRow`` which moves a candy to the first row in the given column if a candy doesn't already exist there
- If a candy is not present, start from the next row and check for a candy in that column to move to the first row
- After the program is completed, if a candy is moved to or already in the first row, return true. If not, return false
- Examples given by CollegeBoard
```java
public boolean moveCandyToFirstRow(int col) {
    // Checks if the first row already has a candy
    if (box[0][col] != null) {
        return true;
    }
    else {
        // If there is no candy, check each row for a candy
        for (int i = 0; i < box.length; i++) {
            // If there is a candy in the row, move it to the first row and remove it from row i and return true
            if (box[i][col] != null) {
                box[0][col] = box[i][col];
                box[i][col] = null;
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    // If no candy is found in every row of the given column, return false
    return false;
}
```

### FRQ 4b
- You now have to write the method ``removeNextByFlavor`` which iterates through the 2D array starting from the bottom left. If there is a Candy that has the same flavor as the parameter ``flavor``, remove that Candy and return it.
- If no Candy in the 2D array has that flavor, return null.
- Examples given by CollegeBoard
```java
public Candy removeNextByFlavor(String flavor) {
    // Iterate through each element by starting at the bottom left 
    for (int row = box.length - 1; row >= 0; row--) {
        for (int col = 0; col < box[0].length; col++) {
            // Store the candy in a variable called c
            Candy c = box[row][col];
            // If a candy exists and its flavor equals the given flavor, remove the candy and return it
            if (c != null) {
                if (c.getFlavor().equals(flavor)) {
                    box[row][col] = null;
                    return c;
                }
            }  
        }
    }
    // If no candy has a matching flavor, return null
    return null;
}
```
