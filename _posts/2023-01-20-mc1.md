# MC Mistakes & Reflections
- Score: 43/52 (.9/1)
## Question 5
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16053597/213769265-21a2a094-8b32-4fe2-837d-78e50f5f4154.png)
- I assumed that the row and column for loops were flipped, namely that each line would contain one row of array data
- The loops were switched such that the outer for loop was looping through the columns
  - Therefore, each line corresponded to one column in the array, which would have yielded the right answer

## Question 7
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16053597/213770916-06119194-77a3-4e9c-8797-feeb86df21bc.png)
- Again I misread the function, I assumed the result string put a "1" if the characters at the same position were equal in both strings, yielding my answeer
- In the actual function, if the characters at the same position were equal in both strings, the same character was appended to the result
   - This results in the "1" at the end of the result string being replaced with a "0" rather than "1" yielding the correct answer

## Question 11
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16053597/213771422-55c42187-9d8c-4348-8def-f0f909846e3c.png)
- Here, I thought that the numbers would be concatinated with the string, resulting in 12Z
- The flaw in my logic is that first 1 and 2 would be added before being cocantinated with Z
   - This resulted in the answer of "3Z" rather than "12Z"

## Question 14
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16053597/213771845-5f503baf-69cb-4447-b9cd-de391864a0af.png)
- Here, I was thinking that normally the outer for loop would reference ``arr`` rather than ``arr[0]``
- Since it was using columns, the existing reference to ``arr[0]`` is correct
- The column index is not iterable, so that resulted in the actual problem, replacing the enhanced for loop to use the iterable ``arr``

## Question 22
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16053597/213772312-ee3a863e-3526-489d-ba0f-5658c801ef27.png)
- Here was just a misread, I thought the array was 3x4 however it was actually a 4x4 leading to the correct answer of 16

## Question 25
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16053597/213772781-c7bbb7b4-b6bb-4419-84f0-997e817a3e66.png)
- I did not fully iterate through this code in my head resulting in the right answer
- If you do this problem thoroughly and on paper you will get the right answer

## Question 35
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16053597/213774137-772d4452-7f28-444a-a799-054b0c428ddf.png)
- In this case I saw the general purpose of the for loop and for which elements it would print
- I misread the loop printing the value of the array rather than the index resulting in my wrong answer

## Question 37
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16053597/213774612-e86ec316-f6a4-4d18-adb4-7a11dca1d951.png)
- I misread the quetion as I thought that it appended str2 to str1
- However, the actual order was str2 and then str1 resulting on str2 always having an index of 0

## Question 38
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16053597/213774818-2792abcd-7f90-48da-b935-15ce75e47ec9.png)
- I misread the for loop thinking it would reverse the whole string
- The loop only goes for i > 0 which means it skips the first character resulting in the right answer
