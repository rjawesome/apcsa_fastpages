# MC Mistakes & Reflections
- Score: 63/66 (.95/1)
- Total: .95+score=score/3
- Time: 78 minutes

# Question 36

- This question was missing the context on the classes, so it was basically impossible to get the right answer. I had to guess

# Question 52
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16053597/214918383-ea87fed3-8633-43b7-911c-a01fbe4a6e06.png)
- I misread the question thinking the method was supposed to return the new price, however it was supposed to modify the instance variable
- To modify the instance variable += must be used resulting in the right answer

# Question 54
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16053597/214918721-532b1ba6-0d65-4bf5-998f-641137110e64.png)
- I misread the question thinking it was looking for a string with increasing characters
- However it is checking if the first character is more than the second character, so it is looking for a decreasing string ("edcba")

# Overall
I think I did much better on this MC than the 55 question one because I spent more time and I am overall happy with my score. There were a couple questions I misread but I don't think this is very major.
