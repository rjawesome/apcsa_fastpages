# Final Score
- My final score was 37/40, and I was pretty happy with this score as it would translate to a 5 on the AP Exam if I did decent on the FRQs and meant I got over a 90% on this.

# Mistakes & Reflections
## Question 15
![question 15 image]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tri1final-15.png)
- I thought that ``I`` and ``II`` were correct code that achieved the objective as they both had a for loop and compared adjacent elements to see if they were sorted
- I did not notice that for ``II``, when ``k`` is ``data.length-1``, the if statement will check ``data[data.length]`` and ``data[data.length-1]``
  - Since the indexes of the array range from 1..data.length-1, ``checking data[data.length]`` will throw an out of bounds exception
- This means only ``I`` was correct and therefore answer choice ``A`` was correct

## Question 26
![question 26 image]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tri1final-26.png)
- I thought that ``C`` was correct because it correctly used an enhanced for loop to traverse the array and checked if the element was odd correctly
- The mistake with this answer choice was that it printed ``arr[x]`` utilizing ``x`` as an index
  - This is incorrect since in an enhanced for loop, ``x`` actually represents the value in the array rather than an index
- This means the correct answer choice was ``A`` which was identical to ``C`` but replaced ``arr[x]`` with ``x``

## Question 30
![question 30 image]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tri1final-30.png)
- I thought that ``B`` was the correct answer as I reasoned that it would first take the characters from index ``3`` to the end ("plier"), and then add the rest of the word ("com")
- I neglected to see that in the question the first substring was using ``howFar + 1`` instead of ``howFar`` as the starting index
  - This means the first string would be "lier" instead of "plier" making the answer "liercom"
- This leads to the correct answer being ``C``

## Overall Reflections
- I felt pretty good about all the concepts covered as most of my mistakes were silly mistakes
- In order to improve my score further I could focus on reading the question and answer choices more closely because that is where most of my mistakes came from
