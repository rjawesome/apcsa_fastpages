## Insights
- I learned that CSU San Marcos is a great choice for university due to its many clubs and internship opportunities. I also learned how important CS is in a variety of fields, especially in science such as physics. I also learned that it is important to reach out for internships and other opportunities, and to know your worth. Finally, it is important to keep track of student loans and other debts as these can be really bad if not managed properly.
