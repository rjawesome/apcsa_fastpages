# Reflections from Yale Video
- We can control our hapiness, it is not just some extrensic factor
- Your intituion isn't always right and recognize that
- Make time for social gatherings as we are social animals
- Helping others improves your own hapiness
- Try to be grateful for what you have (see above)
- Being healthy helps a lot to make you more happy
- Focus on the present moment rather than worrying about past or future
