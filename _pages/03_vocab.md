Here I will keep some important CS Vocab

**Primitives**: A type of data in Java which is basic and does not have any properties/methods (ie ``int``, ``boolean``, ``double``)
**Wrapper Classes**: Classes that allow primitives to be used in places where only classes are allowed such as generics (ie. ``Integer``, ``Boolean``, ``Double``, ``String``)
**Static vs Dynamic Methods**: Static methods are simply called on the class while dynamic methods are called on an INSTANCE of the class (an object)
**Constructors**: These are special methods that are called when an object of a class is created.
